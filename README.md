# Atome PyPi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BaQs/pyAtome.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/BaQs/pyAtome)


Get your energy consumption data from Atome, a Linky-compatible device made by Total/Direct-Energie.

### Installing


```
pip install pyatome
```



## Running the tests


### Break down into end to end tests


## Side notes

As there is no official documentation on the API, I had to reverse-engineer what is the one used in the Atome IOS APP.
This module will cover only the /api path, and not crawl the pages generated by the "graph-query" paths.


## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome, considering the number of features the API provides, there is room for improvement!
