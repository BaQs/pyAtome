# Atome PyPi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BaQs/pyAtome.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BaQs/pyAtome)

Get your energy consumption data from Atome, a Linky-compatible device made by Total/Direct-Energie.

### Installing


```
pip install pyatome
```



## Running the tests
The tox configuration is already included.
Simply launch:
```
$ tox
```

(Do not forget to 'pip install tox' if you do not have it.)
Tests are written in the tests directory.
tests/data folder contains samples of Atome API for tests purposes.


## Side notes

As there is no official documentation on the API, I had to reverse-engineer what is the one used in the Atome IOS APP.
This module will cover only the /api path, and not crawl the pages generated by the "graph-query" paths.


## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome, considering the number of features the API provides, there is room for improvement!
